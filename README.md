# Blazor WASM Learning Repository - Fighting Fantasy Gamebook Companion App

This repository serves as a playground for exploring the capabilities of Blazor WASM while creating a fun and engaging companion app for interactive fiction books, specifically the "Fighting Fantasy" gamebook series.

## Features (planned)

1. Automated dice rolling: Simulate the rolling of two six-sided dice, as required by the gamebook rules.
2. Character sheet management: Create, save, and load character sheets to keep track of your character's attributes, skills, and possessions.
3. Adventure tracking: Record your progress through the gamebook, including the paragraphs you've visited and the choices you've made.

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the "Fighting Fantasy" series or its creators. It is purely a learning exercise and a fan-made companion app intended to enhance the enjoyment of the gamebooks.
